**trbe** is an innovative Web3 platform built to empower fan clubs and their communities by recognizing and rewarding engagement in a transparent way. Designed to integrate seamlessly with social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter), trbe enables existing fan groupsâ€”including sports supporters, eSports communities, and cultural fandomsâ€”to register as official organizations and unlock a new layer of value through blockchain technology.

By linking social interactions to Web3 wallets, trbe accurately measures each fan's digital influence and transforms it into verifiable on-chain reputation. This reputation becomes the basis for a reward system powered by **Fan Tokens**â€”custom digital assets that represent engagement, loyalty, and status within the fan ecosystem.

Fan clubs can use these tokens to:

- **Reward their most active members**, offering exclusive content, VIP access, or physical/digital perks;
- **Monetize fan-driven content**, incentivizing creators and amplifying the club's presence online;
- **Foster a sustainable fan economy**, where influence and participation translate directly into benefits.

Built on the **Chiliz Chain**, trbe introduces a dynamic reputation and reward economy that not only celebrates fandom but also redefines how communities grow and thrive in the Web3 era.
